Notes
---------
Opener as 25-27 HCP and a balanced hand.
Need 33 HCP for small slam, 37 for grand slam
There is no Stayman because a 4C bid is Gerber (asking for Aces).
With 6-7 points (31-34), you may have enough for small slam. Use Gerber.
With 8-9 points (33-36), you have enough for small slam. Just bid it.
With 10-11 points (35-38), you may have enough for grand slam. Gerber.
