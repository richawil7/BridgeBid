Project plan for bridge bidding application

Overview
This application allows a human player to partner with the computer to
practice bidding a bridge hand.

Program Milestones

1. Bootstrap the code
Start with copying the spades application without the git metadata.

2. Modify the deal
Deal cards into 4 piles. Write a function that can evaluate a bridge hand, high card plus distribution points. Evaluate all 4 hands and pick the 2 best ones. Give them to North and South.


3. Bid Output
Get bid box to look good
 - put the header row on the table
 - put borders around the cells

Remove the hardcoded bids

4. Request Bids
Put in a stub which will just return some bid.
Take bid from human by standard input.
Add a check in accepting a bid for a bid level of 8 to indicate bidding is over.
Verify that bids continue around the table until a bid of 8 is received.

5. Multiple Hands
Show that after one hand is done, another hand can be started.
